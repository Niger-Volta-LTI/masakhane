S@@ om@@ e@@ times when she was on her way , he cha@@ sed after her and p@@ ul@@ led her back into the house .
But she would just r@@ un out the other do@@ or and go to the meeting .
I also told the off@@ ici@@ als that I would not become a sol@@ di@@ er .

I was among the Witnesses im@@ pri@@ son@@ ed for ne@@ u@@ tr@@ ality at A@@ sh@@ land , K@@ ent@@ u@@ c@@ k@@ y
That is how we pre@@ ached in an organi@@ zed way .
I wor@@ ri@@ ed about my family because D@@ ad had told me , “ If I can get ri@@ d of you , I can hand@@ le the rest . ”
After my re@@ le@@ ase , I had a pleas@@ ant sur@@ pri@@ se .
I said , “ Th@@ at@@ ’s fine , but I am not going into the ar@@ my . ”
I qu@@ o@@ ted 2 Timothy 2 : 3 and said , “ I am already a sol@@ di@@ er of Christ . ”
After a long s@@ il@@ ence , he said , “ You can leave . ”
So@@ on af@@ ter@@ ward , I att@@ ended the Bethel meeting at a conven@@ tion in C@@ inc@@ in@@ n@@ ati , O@@ hi@@ o .
I also wor@@ ked at As@@ semb@@ ly H@@ al@@ ls in New Y@@ or@@ k C@@ ity .
I have made many friends at Bethel and in the congregation .
I have learned a little M@@ an@@ dar@@ in Ch@@ in@@ ese and enjoy appro@@ aching Ch@@ in@@ ese people on the st@@ re@@ et .

P@@ re@@ aching to the Ch@@ in@@ ese people in Bro@@ o@@ k@@ l@@ y@@ n , New Y@@ or@@ k
I have even made a return vi@@ sit in Ch@@ ina !
She took them and told me that her name was K@@ ati@@ e .
After that , wh@@ en@@ ever she saw me , K@@ ati@@ e came over to talk to me .
I taught her the nam@@ es of fru@@ its and ve@@ ge@@ t@@ ab@@ les in Eng@@ lish , and she re@@ pe@@ ated the words after me .
I also explained Bible te@@ x@@ ts to her , and she accepted the Bible T@@ each book .
After some we@@ e@@ ks , though , she dis@@ appe@@ ared .
The next we@@ ek , she han@@ ded me her c@@ el@@ l ph@@ one and said , “ You talk to Ch@@ ina . ”
I said , “ I don@@ ’t know any@@ body in Ch@@ ina . ”
But she in@@ sist@@ ed , so I took the ph@@ one and said , “ H@@ el@@ l@@ o , this is R@@ ob@@ is@@ on . ”
The voice at the other end said , “ R@@ ob@@ by , this is K@@ ati@@ e .
P@@ le@@ ase teach her the way you taught me . ”
I said , “ K@@ ati@@ e , I will do the best I can .
T@@ han@@ ks for le@@ tting me know where you are . ”
So@@ on af@@ ter@@ ward , I spoke to K@@ ati@@ e@@ ’s sister for the last time .
