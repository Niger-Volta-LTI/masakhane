- Number of Attendees: 17
- Notes taken by Jade Abbott

## Progress Update

## Data

- *Daniel Whitenack* 
- Has a website for geting words for languages which is scrappable, but they can give us bulk exports due to connection. Something for 5700 languages. 
- Deepset need data for a COVID bot. 
- Contribution areas in scrapping data. 
- Bernardt - to be put in touch with Timo 
- https://panlex.org/ 
https://github.com/deepset-ai/COVID-QA 

*Ari* 
- Has spoke with Masabata again


*Wilhemeina*
- Working Musi
- Clean up with regex - should have some data. 
- Damaara. 
- Remove anything except the clicks.

*Allen*
- Working with Wale. English to Fula
- Language is spoken by 18 million.
- Identify some good quality sources of data. 
- 4 News websites.

## Project and Paper Updates

- Jade - reproducability

- Daniel - struggling to get hold of Abdullah to do some more Arabic work! 

- Salomon - discussion - Facebook AI - some note
    - Notes on NLP for Low Resource Languages There are specific resources you might be interested in: https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/1851705/file/6736544#page=39 https://github.com/LauraMartinus/ukuxhumana/blob/master/KNOWN_CORPUSES.md https://www.masakhane.io/ but another approach people have been taking is mining data from the web. The internet contains a lot of text, the key is identifying which of it is in what language, and if it's high quality data. You can check out this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00359 code here: https://github.com/facebookresearch/cc_net and this has been used for bilingual data mining for machine translation as well: https://github.com/facebookresearch/LASER https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.04944.pdf One large challenge is also how to evaluate models in low resource languages, and people have also worked on this: https://research.fb.com/publications/the-flores-evaluation-datasets-for-low-resource-machine-translation-nepali-english-and-sinhala-english/

- Idea: 
    - Find out how to use current model to make chat bots to low resource languages. 
    - Simultaneous languages translation in LRL. 
 
- Chris & Bona & Julia:
    - Building a English chat bot
    - Translating the the training data using the models
    - Daniel & Salomon.
    - 
- Bernardt 
    - If we do African language to english then we can reuse the encoders 
    - once you've done one way turn it around 
    - Easy to access the tensors according to Julia. 

- Kolewale
    - Multilingual?
    - Julia - separate encoder/decoder? Yes, it can be done in JoeyNMT

## Conference Update

- Kathleen got funding for attending ICLR! We'll put together a form so that Masakhaneans can apply to attend!!!
- Video Lecture Series on NLP topics: Robert Munro and Graham Neubig, etc
